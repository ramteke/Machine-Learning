You are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. 

Predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and 3 bedrooms

----------- input ----------- <br>
ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Port- land, Oregon. 
The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.

Given predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and 3 bedrooms ?


<b>How to Solve this ?</b><br>

<img src="Linear%20Regression%20-%20Multiple.png">

Normalize the data, i.e  normalized_value = current_value * mean / standard-deviation

Based on formula, calculate theta for every iteration:
  
  theta = theta - (alpha / m) * (X'*X*theta - X' * y);
  
Now, Predict for some value house with 1650 square feet and 3 bedrooms ?
  
  normalize_size =  1650 - mean(sq.ft) / std(sq.ft) <br>
  normalize_rooms = 3 - mean(rooms) / std(rooms)<br>
  
  Y = [ 1 , normalize_size,  normalize_rooms] * theta
